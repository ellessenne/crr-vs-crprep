# Comparison of crr and crprep + coxph performances
This code has been used to compare the perfomance of `R` code for comparing the performance of `crr` function (`cmprsk` package) and `crprep` + `coxph` (`mstate` and `survival` packages respectively).
Both procedures can be used to estimate a Fine & Gray model for the subdistribution hazard in a competing risks framework.

Results of these simulations have been presented as a poster at the Joint Meeting of the International Biometric Society, Austro-Swiss and Italian Regions (IROeS 2015).
